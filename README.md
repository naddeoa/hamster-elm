Toy application for learning elm. Depends on having the
[hamster-api](https://github.com/naddeoa/hamster-api) running on the same box,
which exposes the Hamster time tracker desktop API via REST.

In the end, you'll get either a web page (if you run `make server`) or an
electron app (if you run `make electron`). I may have some hard coded hostnames
in the html files...
